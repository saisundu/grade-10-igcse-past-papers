For Question 1(f) of the Cambridge IGCSE First Language English exam (May/June 2020, Paper 1), here's a consolidation of the question, marks scheme, and guidelines for proposed responses:

1. Question 1(f):
   - According to Text B, what are the worries and concerns some people have about the new meal-replacement products now available? [15 marks]

2. Mark Scheme for Question 1(f)【92†source】【94†source】【96†source】:
   - The response should be in continuous writing (not note form) and predominantly in the candidate's own words.
   - The summary should not exceed 120 words.
   - Up to 10 marks are available for the content of the answer, and up to 5 marks for the quality of writing.
   - Candidates should use the Marking Criteria for Question 1(f) (Table A Reading and Table B Writing) to guide their answers.
   - Indicative content and specific marking details are provided in the mark scheme.

3. Indicative Reading Content (to be summarized in the candidate's own words)【101†source】【103†source】【105†source】:
   - Manufacturers are primarily concerned with making money from these lucrative products.
   - These products are seen as a fad, fashionable, or a gimmick.
   - They are often marketed as natural, but this can be misleading as the ingredients are overly processed and transformed through complex chemical production processes.
   - They contain intense chemical sweeteners, often sweeter than sugar, and the ingredients may not be accurately labelled, sometimes deliberately disguising what they are.
   - The products are unappealing to the senses, often boring to look at, and their effects are not properly researched.
   - The use of these products affects food linked to culture and ignores the social and emotional experiences associated with eating, which are not just about nutrition but also about how food makes one feel.

4. Reading Levels for Marking (to guide the quality of the response)【107†source】【109†source】:
   - Level 5 [9-10 marks]: A very effective response demonstrating thorough understanding, well-focused, with skillful selection of points.
   - Level 4 [7-8 marks]: An effective and competent response showing good understanding and careful selection of points with some evidence of an overview.

To achieve a Level 5 response for Question 1(f) of the Cambridge IGCSE First Language English exam (May/June 2020, Paper 1), the candidate must demonstrate a thorough understanding of the task, focusing on the worries and concerns about new meal-replacement products. Here's a proposed response, summarizing the key points in the candidate's own words:

---

"Recent trends in meal-replacement products have raised significant concerns. Chief among these is the suspicion that their manufacturers prioritize profit over consumer well-being, leveraging their appeal as a modern convenience. Despite their fashionable status, many criticize these products for their unpalatable taste, contradicting the appealing imagery often presented in marketing campaigns. 

Furthermore, there's a growing unease about the misleading nature of these products. Advertised as natural, they are, in fact, the result of intricate chemical processes, comprising ingredients that are heavily processed and often masked under misleading labels. This extends to the inclusion of intense chemical sweeteners, which surpass the sweetness of sugar, potentially misleading health-conscious consumers.

The sensory and cultural aspects of traditional eating are also under threat. These beige powders, unappealing to both sight and taste, fail to respect the cultural significance of food and the emotional connections we have with eating. This undermines the social and emotional experiences integral to meals, reducing eating to a mere act of nutrition devoid of joy and cultural expression.

In summary, these meal-replacement products, while innovative, overlook vital aspects of what makes food integral to human experience – taste, culture, and emotion."

---

This response effectively addresses the key concerns, maintaining focus and offering an overview of the broader implications of meal-replacement products. It is within the word limit and is written in a manner that demonstrates a high level of comprehension and articulation, aligning with the Level 5 criteria.

For Question 2 of the Cambridge IGCSE First Language English exam (May/June 2020, Paper 1), focusing on Text C, here's a consolidation of the complete questions, marks scheme, and proposed responses for parts (a) to (d):

1. Question 2 (a) - (d)【119†source】:
   - (a) Identify a word or phrase from the text suggesting the same idea as the words underlined. [1 mark each for i-iv]
   - (b) Using your own words, explain what the writer means by each of the words underlined. [1 mark each for i-iii]
   - (c) Use one example from the text to explain how the writer suggests Lois’ feelings while at work, in your own words. [3 marks]
   - (d) Explain how the writer uses language to convey meaning and create effect in paragraphs 10 and 16. Choose three examples of words or phrases from each paragraph to support your answer, including the use of imagery. Write about 200 to 300 words. [Up to 15 marks]

2. Mark Scheme for Question 2 (a) - (d)【123†source】【125†source】【127†source】【129†source】:
   - (a) 
     - (i) "cavernous construction" suggests "a huge building."
     - (ii) "towering" suggests "extremely tall."
     - (iii) "stifled (human) creativity" suggests "stopped people being inventive."
     - (iv) "(wave a) wide eager greeting" suggests "an enthusiastic welcome."
   - (b)
     - (i) "almost exclusively" means "nearly all."
     - (ii) "cold-eyed" means "without emotion showing no reaction."
     - (iii) "identical" means "(exactly) the same without difference."
   - (c) Example and explanation: "staring blankly" suggests "not thinking, losing creativity, lacking emotion." Other possible references include "braids of fibre channel," "knot in my stomach," and "turbine spinning," each indicating different aspects of Lois' emotional and physical state at work.
   - (d) Overview of language use in paragraphs 10 and 16, including examples like "dark confident script," "intrigued me," "fluorescent red," and "rippling burp," each carrying specific connotations and imagery.

3. Proposed Response for Question 2(d):
   - "In paragraph 10, the writer uses vivid imagery to describe Lois’ reaction to the menu. The 'dark confident script' suggests a hint of mystery and reliability, drawing Lois in. The phrase 'intrigued me' indicates her fascination and temptation. The 'exuberant letters' are described as 'loud' and 'colourful,' showing enthusiasm. 'Curling connectors' liken the strokes of writing to natural tendrils, indicating a connection and charm. Finally, 'my life bent off on a different track' suggests a significant change in her future.
   - In paragraph 16, describing her reaction to the Combo, 'consumed' conveys her complete and eager engagement, indicating hunger or incredible taste. 'Healing powers' elevates the experience to a spiritual level. 'Like dishwater' contrasts this by suggesting something unappealing. 'Slathered' and 'fluorescent red' evoke a vivid and intense visual, and 'unclenched' suggests a physical relaxation. The 'rippling burp' is a joyful, natural reaction, showing her contentment."

This consolidation provides a comprehensive overview of the expectations for each part of Question 2, along with guidelines for forming high-quality responses.
