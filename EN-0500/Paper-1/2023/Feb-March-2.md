- **ChatGPT Response**:
For Question 2(d), the task is to explain how the writer uses language to convey meaning and create effect in paragraphs 4 and 5 of "Into the Delta." Here's a sample response:

In paragraph 4, the author creates a serene and almost surreal atmosphere through phrases like "utter tranquility" and "snapshot memory," which convey a sense of peace and a moment captured in time. The imagery of "swishing through the water lilies" evokes a gentle, fluid motion, enhancing the tranquil mood. In contrast, paragraph 5 introduces an element of suspense and anticipation with "Hippo calls carried late across the still waters," where the auditory imagery sets a scene of cautious excitement. The phrase "skilfully manoeuvred our fleet to the very edge of their pool" suggests precision and careful action, heightening the tension as the group approaches the hippos. The language used in both paragraphs effectively contrasts the calmness of the morning journey with the charged atmosphere of the hippo safari later in the day.
