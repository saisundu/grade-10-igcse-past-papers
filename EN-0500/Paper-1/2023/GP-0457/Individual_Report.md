## To What Extent Should governments promote electric vehicles (EVs) to save the environment?

**Topic:** Sustainable Living

**Issue/claim:** EVs can lower the environmental impacts caused by the burning of fossil fuels.

## Introduction

Governments worldwide are in the process of shifting policies in favor of electric vehicles (EVs) to address greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, particularly that of carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions from fossil fuels in Internal Combustion Engines (ICE). Widespread environmental consequences of excessive CO2 emissions affect human health, the global economy, and the natural ecosystem, i.e. the way we know human life on our planet. My report examines the role of EVs in addressing environmental challenges, besides their potential to create a more sustainable transportation future.

### Global Perspective

As shown in Figure 1, transport is a key direct GHG emitter globally. In that sector, as seen in Figure 2, approximately 75% emissions are caused by road vehicles, which is over three times that caused by shipping and aviation together.

The United Nations (UN) Global Electric Mobility Programme Brochure (source 3) says transport is the fastest-growing GHG emitter, and is soon set to reach 30% CO2 emissions, up from 23% in 2021. UN sees EVs as crucial catalysts towards meeting the Paris Climate Agreement goals, a binding treaty between 196 parties. The goal is to limit the increase in global temperatures to below 2 degrees, which would still be above pre-industrial levels. However, the action would prevent catastrophic climate consequences (source 4), a perspective shared by the International Energy Agency (IEA) and other international organizations.

### National Perspective

As shown in Figure 3, my country, India, is among the 7 global most GHG producers, and 14 of the 20 most polluted cities are in India (source 6). So, India has a crucial role to play in containing global GHG emissions and making urban environments cleaner.

According to Mr. Narendra Modi, our Prime Minister, the government has several initiatives under Fame II, such as tax rebates and improved loan application procedures in its bag of tricks to strengthen the EV ecosystem in India (source 7). With a budget of INR one trillion, the scheme supports the demand for electric two, three, and four-wheelers, besides E buses in the country (source 8). Figure 4 shows the number of models approved for subsidies under this scheme. As a result, multiple automakers and vehicle buyers do consider EVs as economically attractive.

One of the largest Indian EV manufacturers, Tata Motors, has sold a milestone of 100,000 EVs in the country. Collectively, EVs have offset 2,19,432 tons of CO2 emissions, and customers have saved INR 7 billion on fuel costs (Source 10).

### Local Perspective

I recently conducted an interview with our school’s transport coordinator to gain a local perspective on the implementation of EVs into our school’s fleet. She said that if our school bus fleet shifts to EVs, there will be many advantages specific and relevant to our school circumstances.

One key issue that she highlighted was the unexpected spike in oil prices in 2021 due to geopolitical issues. This consequently drove up the running cost of our school buses, the transport company passed on the extra cost to the school, and the school passed on the extra cost to the parents. There was approximately a 50% increase in the cost. The oil price hike also affected the price of other essential supplies such as stationary and kitchen supplies, as the cost of transportation increases. This put a lot of pressure on the school’s financials.

She emphasized that the adoption of EVs into the overall transport system will disconnect the price of oil from the price of essential school supplies. This would result in greater financial stability for the school. Secondly, she said that our school is located in an area rich in biodiversity, so clean transport solutions like EVs can be very useful in these areas. EVs operate quietly and don’t have any tailpipe emissions that will affect the local environment adversely.

After recognizing all the benefits of EVs, our school is yet to implement them into the fleet due to a range of practical issues. The transport company serving our school does not have any EVs in their fleet, and the upfront investment required for the school to purchase the buses on its own is far too high.

### Technological Perspective

Elon Musk, the CEO and founder of Tesla, firmly believes that full self-driving (FSD) technology will serve as Tesla's primary Unique Selling Point (USP) in the future within the EV market (source 11). Modern EVs are complexly connected to the internet; this offers many features that improve the driving experience, making driving more automated (source 12). Some of the features present in modern EVs today include the car taking control of all driving decisions, and more importantly, it takes over when the driver is impaired or incapacitated (source 13). Therefore, the automated vehicle is safer than a human driver. Google states that AVs are safer than human drivers (source 14). AVs can save more lives than airbags and seat belts combined. So, there is a very strong case for AVs from a safety perspective.

Apart from being safe, AVs can also serve as a means to transport people more efficiently, i.e. it can improve the utilization of our road infrastructure. Today, most roads are not used to their maximum capacity, and adding more lanes is not a viable option in most cities. AVs can help solve this problem by improving the efficiency of the transportation network (source 15).

### Conclusion

EVs are not a panacea for all the world’s transportation and pollution problems, but they are certainly a very promising step in the right direction. With international and national support for the transition to electric vehicles, a brighter and more sustainable future for transportation is within reach.
