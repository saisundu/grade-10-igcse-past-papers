To plan an investigation to find out how the distance of mass B from the pivot depends on its mass for the beam to be balanced, given the apparatus listed, follow these steps:

1. **Method Description:**
   - Set up the metre rule horizontally on the pivot so that it can rotate freely.
   - Place the 50g mass A at a fixed distance from the pivot on one side of the beam.
   - On the opposite side, place a 10g mass B close to the pivot and move it along the beam until the beam is balanced.
   - Record the position of mass B when the beam is balanced.
   - Increase the mass of B by adding more 10g or 100g masses and again find the new position where the beam balances.
   - Repeat this process for different masses of B, ensuring that mass A remains fixed in its position.

2. **Ensuring Accurate Results:**
   - Use a spirit level to ensure the beam is perfectly horizontal when balanced.
   - Make sure the pivot is at the same mark on the metre rule for each trial for consistency.
   - Calibrate the metre rule if necessary to ensure accuracy in distance measurement.
   - Perform each balance measurement several times and take the average to minimize random error.

3. **Values of Mass B:**
   - Use a range of masses for B, for example, 10g, 20g, 30g, up to a mass that is heavier than A but can be balanced with the metre rule.

4. **Controlling Variables:**
   - Keep the mass of A constant at 50g.
   - Ensure the pivot point is not moved during the experiment.
   - Keep the environment free from drafts or vibrations that might affect the balance.

5. **Measurements:**
   - The distance from the pivot to mass B for each different mass of B when the beam is balanced.
   - The mass of B for each trial.

6. **Recording Results:**
   - Prepare a table with columns for the mass of B, the distance from the pivot to B, and the product of the mass and distance from the pivot (moment of force).

7. **Processing Results:**
   - Calculate the product of mass and distance from the pivot (moment of force) for both A and B.
   - Plot a graph with the mass of B on the x-axis and the corresponding distance from the pivot on the y-axis.

   - Set up the initial experiment as shown in Fig. 2.1 with the water plant in the beaker and the funnel and test-tube in place.
   - Dissolve a small, measured amount of sodium bicarbonate in the water to ensure a consistent supply of carbon dioxide.
   - Place the light source at a set distance from the plant and measure the light intensity using the light meter.
   - Record the starting volume of gas in the test-tube (if any) and start the stopwatch.
   - After a set period (e.g., 30 minutes), measure the volume of gas produced in the test-tube, which indicates the rate of photosynthesis.
   - Repeat the experiment with the light source at half the original distance, which should approximately double the intensity according to the inverse square law.

3. **Variables to Control:**
   - The amount of sodium bicarbonate added to the water.
   - The temperature of the water.
   - The type and age of the water plant.
   - The duration of exposure to the light.

4. **Using Results to Check the Statement:**
   - Calculate the rate of photosynthesis by measuring the volume of gas produced per unit time.
   - Compare the rate of photosynthesis between the two light intensities.
   - If the rate of photosynthesis doubles when the light intensity is doubled, this supports the student’s statement.
   - Plot a graph of light intensity vs. rate of photosynthesis to visually assess the relationship.

For a labeled diagram, you would illustrate the setup similarly to Fig. 2.1, but also include the light meter next to the lamp and mark the distances between the lamp and the plant. Additionally, indicate the direction of light on the diagram. If multiple lamps are used, they should be placed symmetrically around the plant to ensure even distribution of light.
