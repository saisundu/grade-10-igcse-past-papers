   - Place markers inside the tank to define a measurement distance, for example, 40 cm apart.
   - Use the piece of wood to generate a single wave by dipping it into the water and lifting it out again at the first marker.
   - As soon as the wave is generated, start the stopwatch.
   - Stop the stopwatch when the wave reaches the second marker.
   - Record the time taken for the wave to travel between the markers.
   - Repeat the process for different water depths (e.g., 10 cm, 15 cm, etc.), ensuring you return the water to a calm state before generating a new wave.

3. **Variables to Change:**
   - The depth of the water in the tank.

4. **Variables to Control:**
   - The size of the wave generated by the piece of wood.
   - The distance between the markers within the tank.
   - The environmental conditions, such as air currents that could affect the wave's movement.

5. **Measurements:**
   - The depth of water for each trial.
   - The time it takes for a wave to travel the preset distance in the tank.

6. **Processing Results:**
   - Calculate the speed of the wave for each depth using the formula: Speed = Distance / Time.
   - Plot a graph with water depth on the x-axis and wave speed on the y-axis.
   - Analyze the graph to determine the relationship between water depth and wave speed.

By analyzing the results, you can draw conclusions about the relationship between the depth of water and the speed of wave propagation. According to the theory of shallow water waves, the speed of the wave is expected to decrease as the depth increases. This investigation will either confirm or challenge this theory based on the empirical data collected.

To plan an investigation to determine the concentration of salt solution X using the provided apparatus, you could use the principle of floating an object in solutions of known density to create a calibration curve, which can then be used to find the density (and therefore concentration) of the unknown solution. Here’s how the plan would look:

1. **Apparatus:**
   - Five beakers labeled A, B, C, D, and E containing salt solutions of known different concentrations.
   - One beaker labeled X containing the salt solution of unknown concentration.
   - A measuring cylinder large enough to allow a test-tube to float without touching the sides.
   - An empty test-tube.
   - A 30 cm ruler.
   - A balance for weighing salt (if you need to prepare your own known concentrations).
   - Distilled water (if preparing solutions).

2. **Method:**
   - Fill the measuring cylinder with one of the known salt solutions.
   - Gently place the empty test-tube in the cylinder so that it floats.
   - Measure the length of the test-tube that is submerged below the surface of the solution using the ruler.
   - Record this measurement.
   - Repeat the process for each known concentration solution, ensuring to rinse and dry the test-tube between each trial to avoid contamination.
   - After all known concentrations are measured, repeat the process with the unknown concentration solution X.
   - Ensure that the test-tube is handled carefully to avoid any water entering it which would change its buoyancy.

3. **Variables to Control:**
   - The volume of solution used each time should be the same.
   - The test-tube should be dry and empty at the start of each trial.
   - The temperature of the solutions should be consistent as density can change with temperature.

4. **Ensuring Accurate Results:**
   - Use the same test-tube for all trials to ensure consistency.
   - Measure the submerged length of the test-tube at eye level to avoid parallax error.
   - Perform multiple trials for each concentration and take the average to account for any random errors.

5. **Processing Results:**
   - Create a calibration curve by plotting the known salt concentrations on the x-axis against the submerged lengths of the test-tube on the y-axis.
   - Draw the best fit line or curve through the points on the graph.

6. **Determining Concentration of X:**
   - Use the length of the test-tube submerged in solution X to find the corresponding concentration from the calibration curve.
   - If the measurement does not fall exactly on a plotted point, interpolate between the two closest points.

By following this method, you will be able to determine the concentration of the unknown salt solution X by comparing its density to the densities of the known solutions, using the submerged length of the test-tube as an indicator.

### ChatGPT Response

To plan an investigation to test if the student's statement that doubling the intensity of light will double the rate of photosynthesis is correct, you would proceed as follows:

1. **Additional Apparatus and Chemicals:**
   - Light source (e.g., lamp) with adjustable intensity or multiple lamps of the same intensity.
   - Light meter to measure the intensity of light.
   - Sodium bicarbonate (baking soda) to increase the availability of carbon dioxide in the water.
   - Stopwatch to time the experiment.

2. **Method and Measurements:**
   - Set up the initial experiment as shown in Fig. 2.1 with the water plant in the beaker and the funnel and test-tube in place.
   - Dissolve a small, measured amount of sodium bicarbonate in the water to ensure a consistent supply of carbon dioxide.
   - Place the light source at a set distance from the plant and measure the light intensity using the light meter.
   - Record the starting volume of gas in the test-tube (if any) and start the stopwatch.
   - After a set period (e.g., 30 minutes), measure the volume of gas produced in the test-tube, which indicates the rate of photosynthesis.
   - Repeat the experiment with the light source at half the original distance, which should approximately double the intensity according to the inverse square law.

3. **Variables to Control:**
   - The amount of sodium bicarbonate added to the water.
   - The temperature of the water.
   - The type and age of the water plant.
   - The duration of exposure to the light.

4. **Using Results to Check the Statement:**
   - Calculate the rate of photosynthesis by measuring the volume of gas produced per unit time.
   - Compare the rate of photosynthesis between the two light intensities.
   - If the rate of photosynthesis doubles when the light intensity is doubled, this supports the student’s statement.
   - Plot a graph of light intensity vs. rate of photosynthesis to visually assess the relationship.

For a labeled diagram, you would illustrate the setup similarly to Fig. 2.1, but also include the light meter next to the lamp and mark the distances between the lamp and the plant. Additionally, indicate the direction of light on the diagram. If multiple lamps are used, they should be placed symmetrically around the plant to ensure even distribution of light.
