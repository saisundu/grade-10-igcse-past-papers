To plan an investigation for measuring the electrical energy required to increase the temperature of different liquids, you can follow these steps:

1. **Apparatus Needed:**
    - Four separate glass beakers.
    - An electric heater and power supply for each beaker (to ensure simultaneous experiments).
    - A thermometer for each beaker.
    - A stopwatch.
    - A voltmeter and ammeter for each heater setup.
    - Four different liquids: water, salt solution, vegetable oil, and vinegar.

2. **Method Description:**
    - Fill each beaker with an equal volume of one liquid.
    - Set up the electrical circuit as shown in Fig. 4.1, with a voltmeter in parallel and an ammeter in series with the heater.
    - Measure the initial temperature of each liquid.
    - Turn on the heaters and start the stopwatch.
    - Record the voltage (V) and current (I) at regular intervals (e.g., every 30 seconds).
    - Heat each liquid until its temperature has increased by a fixed amount (e.g., 10Â°C).
    - Turn off the heater and stop the stopwatch, noting the final temperature and time (t).

3. **Ensuring Accuracy:**
    - Calibrate the thermometer before use.
    - Check the voltmeter and ammeter for zero error and correct if necessary.
    - Use digital instruments for more precise readings.
    - Stir the liquids gently to ensure even heating.

4. **Variables to Control:**
    - The volume of liquid in each beaker.
    - The starting temperature of the liquids.
    - The increase in temperature (should be the same for each liquid).
    - The time interval for recording voltage and current.

5. **Results Table:**
    - Prepare a table with columns for the liquid type, initial temperature, voltage (V), current (I), time (t), and final temperature.

6. **Processing Results:**
    - Calculate the energy transferred (E) for each liquid using the equation \( E = V \times I \times t \).
    - Compare the energy required for each liquid to reach the target temperature.
    - Analyze the data to determine if different liquids require different amounts of energy to heat up by the same temperature, indicating their specific heat capacities.

7. **Drawing Conclusions:**
    - Use the calculated energies to infer the specific heat capacities of the liquids.
    - Discuss the implications of your findings in relation to the properties of the liquids.
    - Consider experimental errors and suggest improvements for future investigations.

To plan an investigation to find the relationship between the mass of salt added and the decrease in the melting point of cetyl alcohol, follow these steps:

1. **Additional Apparatus Needed:**
    - Analytical balance to measure the mass of cetyl alcohol and salt accurately.
    - Thermometer to measure the melting point of the cetyl alcohol.
    - Spatula to add salt to the cetyl alcohol.
    - A set of standard weights to calibrate the balance.

2. **Method Description:**
    - Measure a fixed amount of powdered cetyl alcohol and place it in the large test-tube.
    - Heat the test-tube gently using the Bunsen burner while stirring the cetyl alcohol to ensure uniform heat distribution.
    - Introduce a fixed amount of powdered salt to the cetyl alcohol and continue to heat it.
    - Record the temperature at which the cetyl alcohol starts to melt.
    - Repeat the experiment with increasing amounts of salt while keeping the amount of cetyl alcohol constant.
    - Ensure to cool down the apparatus to room temperature before repeating the experiment with a different mass of salt.

3. **Safety Precautions:**
    - Wear safety goggles and lab gloves to protect against splashes and heat.
    - Handle the Bunsen burner with care, ensuring that there are no flammable materials nearby.
    - Be cautious while measuring the melting point to avoid burns.

4. **Measurements:**
    - Mass of salt added to the cetyl alcohol.
    - Melting point of the cetyl alcohol after the addition of salt.

5. **Variables to Control:**
    - The mass of cetyl alcohol should be constant in each trial.
    - The environmental temperature should be consistent.
    - The heat applied should be as uniform as possible in each trial.

6. **Results Table:**
    - Create a table with columns for trial number, mass of salt added, observed melting point, and change in melting point from the pure cetyl alcohol.

7. **Processing Results:**
    - Plot a graph with the mass of salt on the x-axis and the decrease in melting point on the y-axis.
    - Analyze the trend to determine if there is a linear relationship or any pattern.
    - Use the data to draw a conclusion about how the mass of salt affects the melting point of cetyl alcohol.

8. **Drawing Conclusions:**
    - Discuss the observed relationship and its consistency with the expected scientific principles.
    - Consider any anomalies or inconsistencies in your results and explore possible explanations.
    - Suggest improvements for further research and potential applications of your findings.
