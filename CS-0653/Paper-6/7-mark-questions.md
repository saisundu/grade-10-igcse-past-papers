To plan an investigation for measuring the electrical energy required to increase the temperature of different liquids, you can follow these steps:

1. **Apparatus Needed:**
    - Four separate glass beakers.
    - An electric heater and power supply for each beaker (to ensure simultaneous experiments).
    - A thermometer for each beaker.
    - A stopwatch.
    - A voltmeter and ammeter for each heater setup.
    - Four different liquids: water, salt solution, vegetable oil, and vinegar.

2. **Method Description:**
    - Fill each beaker with an equal volume of one liquid.
    - Set up the electrical circuit as shown in Fig. 4.1, with a voltmeter in parallel and an ammeter in series with the heater.
    - Measure the initial temperature of each liquid.
    - Turn on the heaters and start the stopwatch.
    - Record the voltage (V) and current (I) at regular intervals (e.g., every 30 seconds).
    - Heat each liquid until its temperature has increased by a fixed amount (e.g., 10Â°C).
    - Turn off the heater and stop the stopwatch, noting the final temperature and time (t).

3. **Ensuring Accuracy:**
    - Calibrate the thermometer before use.
    - Check the voltmeter and ammeter for zero error and correct if necessary.
    - Use digital instruments for more precise readings.
    - Stir the liquids gently to ensure even heating.

4. **Variables to Control:**
    - The volume of liquid in each beaker.
    - The starting temperature of the liquids.
    - The increase in temperature (should be the same for each liquid).
    - The time interval for recording voltage and current.

5. **Results Table:**
    - Prepare a table with columns for the liquid type, initial temperature, voltage (V), current (I), time (t), and final temperature.

6. **Processing Results:**
    - Calculate the energy transferred (E) for each liquid using the equation \( E = V \times I \times t \).
    - Compare the energy required for each liquid to reach the target temperature.
    - Analyze the data to determine if different liquids require different amounts of energy to heat up by the same temperature, indicating their specific heat capacities.

7. **Drawing Conclusions:**
    - Use the calculated energies to infer the specific heat capacities of the liquids.
    - Discuss the implications of your findings in relation to the properties of the liquids.
    - Consider experimental errors and suggest improvements for future investigations.
